                <img src="cheeseway.jpg" alt="cheeseway" />

                <p>Who Moved My Cheese is a metaphorical exploration of how people deal with change in their lives. Through a simple parable featuring four characters (two mice and two little people), the book illustrates different reactions to unexpected changes, particularly in relation to achieving goals, securing stability, or maintaining comfort zones.

                <li><b>Scurry:</b> Embraces change and takes immediate action.</li>
                <li><b>Hem:</b> Resists change out of fear, hoping things will return to normal.
                </li>
                <li><b>Haw:</b> Initially resistant but eventually learns to adapt and embrace change.

                <h1>characters and Reaction to Change</h1>
                <p>We all like to think we handle change well, like Sniff and Scurry, but in reality, we exhibit all four tendencies at different times. Sometimes we deny change, other times fear of failure holds us back, and occasionally, we embrace it quickly when it feels favorable. We often slip into comfort zones, only to be shaken up, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The key lesson is that it's never too late to change how we deal with changeâ€”just like Haw did. If he can, why can't we?
